# World of Warcraft Achievement Creator (faker)

This addon NO LONGER works since 9.1.5 -> Blizzard has implemented more checks thus invalidating this addon. Sorry!

Create fake achievements in World of Warcraft to easily get into groups, impress your friends or guildies (without any effort.. duh!)

## Installation:

Extract the ZIP and put it into your World of Warcraft addons folder (World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns by default)

## Example:

Target the character you want to 'assign' this achievement to. If it's just yourself, click on your portrait.

`/achievement_create ID DATE`

In-Game use the following command `/Achievement_Create 14690 10/05/2021` to give yourself "Sinful Gladiator: Shadowlands Season 1". To get this ID, copy it from the WoWHead URL in your browser. (https://www.wowhead.com/achievement=14690)

![Achievement](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brian8544/Achievement_Creator/main/Dep/Images/Screenshot.png)

You can find all ID's from WoWHead or other relevant sites that show achievement id's

### Available Commands:

`/achievement_create`
`/achiev_create`
`/ach_create`
